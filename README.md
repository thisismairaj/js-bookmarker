# JS-Based Bookmarker Application

This is an app purely based on vanilla JavaScript. It uses Chrome's LocalStorage to as its database for storing bookmarkers. There is special use of JSON for storing, parsing and reading these bookmarkers. So you are bound to learn something, if you're new to this JSON thing.

## Built For Practice

I practice things; this repo, app, etc., is yet another practice session. Nothing more or less. Equally useful for developers as well as for the makers (me!).
